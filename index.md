## Advanced Computer Programming in Python

![](https://advancedpythonprogramming.github.io/images/cover-front.png)

This book covers most of the advanced topics in Computer Programming, such as Object Oriented Design, Data Structures, Functional Programming, MetaClasses, Abstract Classes, Exceptions, Testing, Threading, Simulation, Graphical Interfaces, Input/Output, Networking and Web Services. All these topics are based on the Python 3 language. On each chapter, besides the theory, there is always code showing examples of applications. Also, at the end of each chapter, there are two hands-on activities, where a harder problem is defined, encouraging readers to solve them by themselves. We include all the solutions at the end of the book
